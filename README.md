# Overview
![pointing finger](point.avif)

When programming in C++, it's inevitable that you're going to run into pointers at some point. Pointers are all over C++. Especially if you are using a library or toolkit developed by professional developers, it's nice to understand what pointers are and what they do.

[\\] ( In this tutorial, I go over some basic pointers, then explore how pointers are implimented in a more complicated, industry standard program. This tutorial features [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/), a physics simulation toolkit written entirely in C++. This provides some real-world applications of pointers and shows off just how powerful they can be. )
